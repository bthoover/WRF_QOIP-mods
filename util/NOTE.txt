UPPER_TROP:

To focus on the upper troposphere, 2 modifications are made to util/ programs:

compute_optimal_perturbation.py
compute_DELTAR_delR_ratio_error.py

You need to use the *_UPPER_TROP versions of both of these programs when running QOIP, and replicate settings
changes in each independently to construct the upper-tropospheric weighting (should be identical weighting in
each, but has to be set in both programs).

The upper-tropospheric weighting mechanism is based on defining a beta distribution with the PERT function to
compute a smooth weighting that maximizes at a chosen level and tapers to zero outside of two chosen boundary
levels. This is in-effect a smoothing of a triangular distribution. For the use-case of investigating the
outflow level of a hurricane, I set the maximized weighting level to the perceived level of maximum divergence
over the hurricane, and the boundary levels to the top-level and roughly the halfway-point of the column. You
could choose to set these any way you want so long as the mode is in-between the min and max levels (a sanity
check requirement), and while this is called "UPPER_TROP" you could just as easily set this to focus on the
mid-levels or lower-trop as needed.

The weighting is all relative to the PERT distribution value at the maximized level (the mode), so the weight
is 1.0 at this level and decays to 0.0 as you approach the boundary-levels. Settings are:

kmin (float)  : minimum k-value for weighting function (w=0.0 for k <= kmin)
kmode (float) : k-value where weighting function reaches w=1.0
kmax (float)  : maximum k-value for weighting function (w=0.0 for k >= kmax)




NO_COMPENSATING_MOISTURE:

If you want to turn off the compensating moisture term and only perturb the other variables, you can do it
with the modifed version of:

add_optimal_perturbation.py

In this version, the compensating moisture term is computed, but never passed along to the wrfinput file.

You could use this same method to zero-out other variables if desired.
